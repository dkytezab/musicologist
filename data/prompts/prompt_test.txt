This is an Algerian folk music, also known as Rai. There is a male vocalist singing in a chant-like manner. There is a flute playing the main melody while the rhythm is being provided by several percussive elements. There is a lively feel to it. This piece could be used in the opening shots of a movie taking place in North Africa. It could also be in the soundtrack of a desert-themed video game.
